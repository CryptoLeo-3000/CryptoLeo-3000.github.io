                separate schools in Business Management, Pharmacy,

                scenic serene environment which provides an ideal 
                atmosphere for pursuing higher education programs in 
                management away from the noise and pollution of a metro 
                city. SVKM's NMIMS Navi Mumbai Campus provides an idyllic 
                environment to engage in learning and the unique 
                distinction of gaining ringside insight to metropolitan 
                corporate dynamics against a budding and emerging business 
                hub.
