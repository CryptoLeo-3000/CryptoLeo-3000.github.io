            <p class="Abouttext">
                I.I.M.U.N. (India's International Movement to Unite Nations) 
                is the worldâ€™s largest youth-run organisation that aims to 
                bring the world closer, the Indian way. I.I.M.U.N. empowers 
                the youth by enabling them to solve glocal problems at an 
                individual level. The organisation comprises of 26,000 young 
                organisers who put together student conferences in 160 cities 
                across 22 countries, and work with over 7,500 schools 
                impacting 10 million students. The organization simulates the 
                workings of Indian Parliament and multi-lateral  organisations 
                for school students to engage them in debates about 
                international relations, current affairs and world politics. 
                The aim  of the organisation is to get Indian students between 
                13 to 19 to become global citizens with an Indian mind-set.

                project for designing an app for the organisation for 
                Android and iOS. The app was  designed using Figma designing
